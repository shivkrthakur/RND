REMOVE DIRECTORY FROM GIT AND LOCAL:
You could checkout 'master' with both directories;
git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)

REMOVE DIRECTORY FROM GIT AND NOT LOCAL:
Remove the directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local): git rm -r --cached myFolder

REMOVE A FILE FROM GIT:
git rm file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"

If you want to overwrite only one file:
git fetch
git checkout origin/master <filepath>
If you want to overwrite all changed files:

git fetch
git reset --hard origin/master
(This assumes that you're working on master locally and you want the changes on the origin's master - if you're on a branch, substitute that in instead.)


From the git-diff manpage:
git diff [--options] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>...]
For instance, to see the difference for a file "main.c" between now and two commits back, here are three equivalent commands:

$ git diff HEAD^^ HEAD main.c
$ git diff HEAD^^..HEAD -- main.c
$ git diff HEAD~2 HEAD -- main.c
