REMOVE DIRECTORY FROM GIT AND LOCAL:
You could checkout 'master' with both directories;
git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)

REMOVE DIRECTORY FROM GIT AND NOT LOCAL:
Remove the directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local): git rm -r --cached myFolder

REMOVE A FILE FROM GIT:
git rm file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
